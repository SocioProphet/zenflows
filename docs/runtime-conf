When running in production, the following environment variables can be
passed to Zenflows (all number ranges are inclusive):

    * DB_HOST: The hostname to connect to for the database.  The default
      is `localhost'.
    * DB_PORT: The port number of the database.  The default is 5432.
      It must be an integer between 0 and 65535.
    * DB_NAME: The name of the database in PostgreSQL.  The default is
      `zenflows'.
    * DB_USER: The username of the PostgreSQL user/role to connect as.
      It is required if DB_SOCK is not provided.
    * DB_PASS: The passphrase of the PostgreSQL user/role to connect as.
      It is required if DB_SOCK is not provided.
    * DB_SOCK: The path to the Unix socket of PostgreSQL.  It takes
      presence over DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, and DB_PASS.

    * PASS_ITER: Iteration count for the hashing.  The default is
      160000.  It must be an integer between 1024 and 1073741823.
    * PASS_KLEN: The length in octets for the derived key.  The default is
      64.  It must be an integer between 1 and 4294967295.
    * PASS_SLEN: The length in octets for the randomly-generated salt.
      The default is 16.  It must be an integer between 16 and 255.

You can put these in a file, for example, called `env' and do:

    env $(cat env) zenflows start

to start the application easily with your configuration.
