# Zencode scripts used in Zenflows

Zencode is executed by the [Zenroom](http://zenroom.org) VM running inside a crypto-provider micro-service locally reachable by Zenflows.

The language documentation is found on [dev.zenroom.org](https://dev.zenroom.org).

The `src` directory contains scripts called by the running Zenflows instance.

The `test` directory contains unit tests (single scripts tested in local) and integration tests (shell scripts that call zenflows staging instances to test its api).
