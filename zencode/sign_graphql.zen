# The input expected is a graph query encoded as base64
# and signed using ecdh

Scenario schnorr: sign a graph query

Given I have a 'base64' named 'graphql'
and I have a 'keyring'

When I create the schnorr signature of 'graphql'
Then print 'schnorr signature' as 'base64'
and print 'graphql' as 'base64'
