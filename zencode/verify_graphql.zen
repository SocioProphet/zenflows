Scenario schnorr: verify the signature of a graph query

Given I have a 'base64' named 'graphql'
and a 'schnorr signature'
and a 'schnorr public key' in 'pubkeys'

When I verify the 'graphql' has a schnorr signature in 'schnorr signature' by 'schnorr public key'

Then print the string 'VALID SIGNATURE'
